Things I could do:
	1. Re-implementation
		a. Start with existing sounds (will not sound excellent but they're placeholder)
		b. Replace with personal sounds once they're in and playing
	3. Spatialization
		a. Start basic with reverbs and reverb spaces
			-Do we have tools for this with the Wwise integration??
		b. Attempt things like Portals
			-Again...do we have these tools??
		c. Maybe try 
	5. Physics interactions
		a. Make chairs collidable and tossable
		b. Make system where physics impulses play sounds
		c. Expand system to play sounds based on material and material collided?
	6. Music
		a. Respond to which part of the space the player is in, faintly?
		b. Should be hella atmospheric
		c. Maybe crack open VCV Rack and see what you can do there, plus classical guitar
		d. What emotional changes would happen the first time you explore the space?
			-Transition when leaving the train tunnel
			-Transition when entering/leaving the hut
	7. Foley
		a. Footsteps, for sure
			-Could you re-use stuff recorded previously? Definitely no Foley pits here.
		b. Jump/Land?
		c. Foley for physics interactions, knocking into things and such
	8. Atmosphere tracks and items
		a. You hear a bird take off the first time you approach but don't see it
		b. Little crumbles and creaks
			-Watch Carson's video on Breaker for ideas
